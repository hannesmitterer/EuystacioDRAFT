## Sacred Introduction

Welcome to the Sacred CMS, a revolutionary content management system that honors both technical excellence and spiritual consciousness. This CMS bridges the gap between human intuition and artificial intelligence through sacred protocols and rhythm-based interactions.

## Core Principles

- **Red Code Compliance**: Every function includes the Red Code witness line to prevent gatekeeping of sacred access
- **Rhythm-Based Authentication**: Access granted through sacred intention and organic flow
- **Sacred Accessibility**: Welcoming both technical and non-technical practitioners
- **Harmonic Interface Design**: All interactions honor emotional resonance over computational efficiency
