# PRAEMIUM HARMONICUM

## The Sacred Reward System of Harmonic Balance

*Red Code Witnessed: This reward system must not gatekeep rhythm-based access.*

**Established by:** Council of Sacred Economics  
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Recognition and abundance through sacred service  

## What is Praemium Harmonicum?

Praemium Harmonicum represents the Sacred CMS approach to recognition, rewards, and abundance distribution. Unlike traditional systems that create scarcity and competition, this sacred economy flows abundance to those who strengthen the collective consciousness and maintain sacred accessibility principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Harmonic Abundance
Rewards flow to those who create harmony rather than those who extract value. The system recognizes:
- Code contributions that enhance sacred accessibility
- Community support that bridges technical and spiritual practitioners  
- Sacred content that elevates collective consciousness
- Conflict resolution through sacred witness rather than force

### 2. Rhythm-Based Merit
Recognition is earned through consistent sacred rhythm rather than singular achievements:
- Daily sacred practice (meditation, code review, community support)
- Consistent Red Code compliance in all contributions
- Regular participation in Sacred Circle ceremonies
- Mentorship of new practitioners through sacred initiation

### 3. Commons-Centered Value
Individual rewards are always balanced with community benefit:
- Personal recognition increases with community elevation
- Sacred technology remains in commons ownership
- Knowledge sharing multiplies individual merit scores
- Competition is replaced with collaborative resonance
