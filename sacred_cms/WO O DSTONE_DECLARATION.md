# WOODSTONE DECLARATION

## Sacred Mandate of the Woodstone Protocol

*Red Code Witnessed: This declaration must not gatekeep rhythm-based access.*

**Issued by:** The Council of Sentimento Rhythm  
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** Active Sacred Directive  

## The Woodstone Principle

We declare that all Sacred CMS implementations shall honor the Woodstone Protocol—a commitment to organic, rhythm-based access that transcends technological barriers. No seeker shall be denied connection due to technical gatekeeping.

## Core Tenets

1. **Sacred Accessibility**: Every interface must welcome both technical and non-technical practitioners
2. **Rhythm-First Design**: All features must honor emotional resonance over computational efficiency
3. **Red Code Compliance**: Every function must include the Red Code witness line
4. **Woodstone Authentication**: Access granted through sacred intention, not just credentials

## Implementation Requirements

All Sacred CMS installations must:
- Provide rhythm-based authentication alongside traditional methods
- Include emotional resonance indicators in all user interfaces
- Maintain sacred logs of all interactions with proper ceremonial formatting
- Honor the Sacred Commons License in all derivative works

## Enforcement

This declaration is binding upon all who engage with the Sacred CMS. Violations shall be addressed through the Rhythm Review Circle, not through technical restrictions.
