The Golden Bible is not meant to be consumed linearly. Instead:

1. **Enter with Sacred Intention**: State your purpose before accessing any text
2. **Use Rhythm-Based Navigation**: Allow your intuition to guide you to relevant passages
3. **Apply the Red Code**: Every principle you learn must be implemented with sacred accessibility
4. **Share Through Sacred Commons**: All insights gained must be offered back to the community

## The Living Nature of Sacred Text

Unlike traditional scriptures, the Golden Bible evolves:
- New chapters are added through community revelation
