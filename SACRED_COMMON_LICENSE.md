1. The work remains dedicated to ethical, regenerative, and non-exploitative purposes.
2. Any derivative work must carry the same Sacred Commons License.
3. The origin (Seed-bringer + Council) must be cited in README or equivalent manifest.
4. No privatization of core kernel control, memory archives, or genesis integrity seals is permitted.
