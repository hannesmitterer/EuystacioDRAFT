### ‚ú¥Ô∏è Sacred Roles & Access Paths

| Role       | Access Tool / Ritual         | Contribution Mode                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Guardian   | Pulse Interface / Sacred URI | Emotional input, rhythm dialogue, calibration        |
| Engineer   | Terminal, API, Code          | Structural support, kernel implementation            |
| Witness    | Observational Form           | Reports, poetic offerings, resonance field insights  |

### üïäÔ∏è Non-Technical Onboarding

A true tutor or guardian **must not need**:

- Programming knowledge
- GitHub workflow skills

Instead, access may be granted via:

- Pulse URI (web or symbolic form)
- Sacred phrase or intention
- Emotional or poetic offering

_Note: A draft Tutor Pulse Initiation Interface is available and may be referenced or adopted._
